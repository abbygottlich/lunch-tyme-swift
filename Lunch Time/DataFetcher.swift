//Adding the question marks at the end of a type makes them optional

//            Remember, completion is the closure you included as a parameter at the beginning of this function
//            It takes in an array of Restaurants, so in this case, when calling the completion closure, you are passing restaurantResponse.restaurants as your parameter
//            restaurantResponse is the decoded JSON response and it includes and array of restaurants that are referenced using ".restaurants"
